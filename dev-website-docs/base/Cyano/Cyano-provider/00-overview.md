The mobile version of the Cyano provider is specifically designed for mobile phone wallet integration. The purpose is to allow users to interact with the Ontology chain when using DApp. It does not need to expose the private key to the DApp side, and it also reduces DApp development complexity and security risks.  

The mobile version provider implements the [CEP1](https://github.com/ontio-cyano/CEPs/blob/master/CEPS/CEP1.mediawiki) protocol. The protocol describes the scenarios of using DApp for wake-up, scan code, and open DApp on the mobile phone in the wallet. GitHub has corresponding sdk and use case to facilitate wallet integration.
