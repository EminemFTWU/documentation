### 1 What is OEP-4, OEP-5, OEP-8?

ONT Enhancement Proposals (OEP) describes the standards of the ONT platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs and contract standards.

The OEP-4 proposal is the standard interface for tokens, which allows the implementation of standard APIs for tokens in smart contracts. OEP-4 is a standardized token. [OEP-4 Token List](https://explorer.ont.io/token/list/oep4/10/1)

The OEP-5 proposal is the standard interface for NFT, which allows the implementation of standard APIs for tokens in smart contracts. NFT's standard token interface allows tokens on the ONT to be used by other applications. [HyperDragons Go](https://hyd-go.alfakingdom.com/) The dragon in the game is the token of the OEP-5 standard.

The OEP-8 proposal is the standard interface for Crypto Item, which allows you to transfer any number of tokens for differential encryption items from one address to another. It combines the advantages of OEP-4 and OEP-5 to make it easy to transfer different types of Crypto Item. [Ontology Pumpkin](https://explorer.ont.io/token/detail/oep8/edf64937ca304ea8180fa92e2de36dc0a33cc712/10/1) is the token of the OEP-8 standard.

### 2 What scenarios are currently supported using DApi access?

DApi access currently supports the following scenarios:
- [Open DApp in mobile wallet] (https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/dApp-Integration/01-DAppDocking-Wallet-Opens-DApp)
- [Use mobile wallet to scan code] (https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/dApp-Integration/02-DAppDocking-QRcode)
- [Use chrome plugin wallet] (https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/dApp-Integration/03-DAppDocking-use-chrome-extension-wallet)
- [Wake Up Mobile Wallet] (https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/dApp-Integration/06-DAppDocking-Wake-up)

### 3 What should I do if my DApp needs to synchronize information on the chain?

When the dApp needs to query the data on the chain (such as transaction records, etc.), it can be queried through the public [explorer api](https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/explorer/overview). The method is applicable to some dApps with a small query frequency and a small amount of queries. For some high-frequency query dApps, the query through the browser interface cannot meet the business requirements, so we have introduced the data on the synchronization chain to the application. The method of the database. For details, please refer to [Information on Sync Chain](https://dev-docs.ont.io/#/docs-en/dApp-Integration/05-DAppDocking-Sync)
