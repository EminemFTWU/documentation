The Ontology Software Development Kit (SDK) is the bridge between the application and the ontology network. Based on a common set of ontology software development kit development specifications, we offer a multi-language software development kit to meet the needs of different developers.

The SDK can provide the following features:
- interact with the chain
-  account number
